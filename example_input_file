# Lines that start with # are ignored as comments.
# Want multi-line comments? Tough. Use multiple #s

   
# Blank lines, even ones with white space, are fine.

A
B -> D
E,F - > G

# In these examples:
#   A is unrelated to any other organism
#   D is a child of B, and an unmaned third organism that is unrelated to any other organism
#   G is a child of E and F

H,I->J
K     ,    L     ->       M

# Spread out, or bunch up, either way is fine.

N, AVeryLongNameThatWouldActuallyBeReallyCumbersomeToType -> P

# The label for an organism can be as long as you would like

ZZ9PluralZAlpha -> QQ7ActiveJGamma

# And contain both numbers and letters

42 -> 22B

# And even start with numbers.

}z!i*i^l;j' -> a"$b%c@()

# And contain and start with symbols apart from ',' '-' and '>'.

# A name like this -> is not okay

# But no spaces

# A>B, D,E -> F-G

# And none of the aforementioned special characters

Q, R -> S
Q, R -> T
Q, R -> U

# Different organisms can have the same pair of parents.

Q, V -> X
Y, R -> Z

# An organism can pair with more than one other organism to produce children


AA, BB -> CC
AA, BB -> DD
# CC, DD -> AA <---!! NOPE!

# Sorry, I don't support time travel, organisms cannot be their own descendants

# EE, -> FF <---!! NO.
# EE,FF <---!! Also NO.
# EE, FF - > GG <---!! Still NO.
# -> G <---!! Why would you even think that?
